# Xcerebro County Intelligence Framework

**Copyright © 2026 Xcerebro LLC. All rights reserved.**
Licensed under the proprietary Xcerebro LLC VIP license. See `LICENSE.md`. This Framework is not open source; access is limited to active Xcerebro LLC VIP members and approved licensees.

Reusable framework for building autonomous county-lead-intelligence dashboards in any county.

This is not a county-specific build. It is a portable shell. The only file that should change per county is the target county config inside `config/counties/`.

---

## Quick start — one sentence install

**First time using this framework?** Read [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md) for the full first-run walkthrough. The short version:

1. **Clone or open** your private county-build repo (this repo).
2. **Open Claude Code** in the repo directory:
   ```
   claude
   ```
3. **Type one sentence** when Claude Code's prompt appears:
   ```
   Build <County Name>, <State>.
   ```
   Substitute your actual county and state. See `START_HERE.md` for a worked example.
4. Claude Code parses the target, shows the interpreted slug, asks approval to run the bootstrap script, and proceeds through Phase 0 autonomously.
5. **Approve the bootstrap once** when Claude Code asks. The bootstrap script creates `runs/<slug>/` and the launch instructions — nothing else.
6. **Watch Phase 0 run.** Claude Code performs County Source Recon and the Onboarding Gate. When it stops, it prints a change manifest. Review the manifest before authorizing Phase 1.

That's it. No PowerShell commands beyond `claude`. No JSON to edit by hand. No manual launch file to create.

> **Why the one-time approval click?** Claude Code asks before running shell commands by default — that's protection against destructive operations. The autonomous first-run grant is bounded to `scaffold/bootstrap_county.py` only, which creates a folder and a markdown file. Approve once and the bootstrap runs in seconds.

### Autonomy boundaries (v5.3.1)

The first run is autonomous in the sense that you type one sentence and approve one bootstrap. Everything after that — source recon, 5-layer verification gate, auto-resolve of blockers, config writing, and the change manifest — runs hands-off.

There are three boundaries operators should know about:

1. **Claude Code may ask for approval to run bounded scripts.** During Phase 0, Claude Code may request permission for `web_search`, `web_fetch` against official portal domains, and one Python script call to atomically write the populated county config (via `scaffold/ops/write_county_config.py` — see MASTER_PROMPT Section 4.28). Approve broadly; the scope is bounded to the current county repo.
2. **Claude Code stops on config-write failure.** If the writer returns `JSON_INVALID` or `SCHEMA_INVALID`, Claude Code attempts exactly one structured repair and then stops with `CONFIG_WRITE_FAILED` if the second attempt also fails. It does NOT silently proceed. Open the resulting `runs/<slug>/CONFIG_WRITE_FAILED.md` for diagnosis.
3. **The framework is universal; the county is configured.** A hard contract (MASTER_PROMPT §4.31) requires that universal pipeline code never contains county-specific data. Counties enter the pipeline through `config/counties/<slug>.json`, `scrapers/<source>.py`, and the translator registry — never through hardcoded source dispatch or in-code municipality lists. This means the same `scaffold/pipeline/` runs for any county.

Phase 0 ends at a Build Mode Approval Gate. Build Mode (scrapers, dashboards, deployment) only starts when the operator explicitly authorizes it.

## What this framework does

**The product is fresh county-level distress intelligence with daily refresh.** The county is the moat. Daily refresh is non-negotiable. Fresh distress signals are the core asset. Enrichment data supports county intelligence; it never replaces it.

Every county built on this framework inherits:

**Distress ingestion (the moat):**
- Daily ingestion of fresh county distress filings: clerk recordings, court dockets, sheriff sales, code enforcement, tax delinquency
- Source priority tiers (P0 daily-distress / P1 weekly-distress / P2 enrichment) — Phase 0 build halts if no P0 source is unblocked
- Lifecycle reasoning over fresh filings — chronology, status engine, suppression of resolved signals (releases, satisfactions, discharges, dismissals)
- Source heartbeat and cursor tracking so daily refreshes don't duplicate or miss records
- Telegram alerts for new high-stack leads, source failures, session expiry, regressions

**Normalization and scoring:**
- Universal document normalization layer translating raw recorder/court abbreviations and OCR-corrupted text into canonical document types before scoring
- Source-classified, scored, deal-path-classified leads (wholesale / flip / sub-to / seller-finance / partial-interest / messy-title / rental-acquisition / dispo-only / do-not-pursue)
- Title complexity as a dimension separate from motivation, gating which deal paths are operationally viable
- Strict evidence ledger attached to every field and every claim

**Enrichment (supporting role only):**
- Entity resolution for individuals, LLCs, trusts, estates, parcels, addresses, cases, and instruments
- Parcel master / appraisal district enrichment for assessed value, equity proxy, owner mailing
- GIS / USPS vacancy / utility shutoff feeds where available

**Infrastructure:**
- GitHub private repo + GitHub Pages dashboard hosting (revocable client access)
- Optional Supabase database storage for production scale
- Live-browser verification and auto-rollback: contract defined in v5.3.0 (§20 Semantic Verification Contract). Production implementation deferred to a future harness release. v5.3.0 ships the contract surface and a documentation-grade reference implementation template (scaffold/ops/semantic_verify_template.py); production verifier and watchdog infrastructure are per-county responsibility until universal production tooling lands.
- Synthetic test harness before real county data enters the system

## Who this is for

Real estate operators who build lead-generation systems for investor clients. The framework's clients are wholesalers, flippers, creative-finance investors, partial-interest specialists, and messy-title investors. **They will physically call the leads this system produces.** Every architectural decision serves that.

## Universal rule

Do not hardcode a county. Do not hardcode a state. Do not carry assumptions from a previous county build. Each county is discovered from its own config and `RECON.md`.

## How to use it (detailed)

**For first-time use, see the Quick Start at the top of this README or read `START_HERE.md`.** The flow below is the manual / advanced operator path used when bootstrap autonomy is not desired (e.g. CI environments, custom slug conventions, or scripted builds).

1. Read `MIGRATION.md` end-to-end.
2. Create a private GitHub repo for the county build (e.g. `<county-slug>-intel`).
3. Copy this directory into the new repo.
4. **Either** run `python scaffold/bootstrap_county.py --county "<Name>" --state "<State>" --slug <slug> --phase phase0` (recommended), **or** manually copy `config/counties/_template.json` to `config/counties/<slug>.json` and populate it. The template is intentionally not valid as a live county config until placeholders are filled.
5. Open Claude Code in the repo and paste this:
   ```
   Read MASTER_PROMPT.md and runs/<slug>/LAUNCH_<SLUG_UPPER>.md. Run Phase 0 only.
   ```
6. Claude Code runs Phase 0 → review change manifest → operator authorizes Phase 1 → Claude Code runs Phase 1 → review → and so on.
7. Run the deployment checklist in `MIGRATION.md` after Phase 8 completes.
8. The county is autonomous and refreshing daily.

## County build workflow

The framework's build sequence, phase by phase:

1. **Run Phase 0: County Source Recon and Onboarding Gate** — Walk the exhaustive source-category checklist in `knowledge_base/domain/02_signals_and_sources.md` "Phase 0 source-category checklist". For each category: discover the URL by following official navigation, verify it's reachable, classify `official_status` and `lead_value`, set `source_priority` and `build_priority`, produce a portal fingerprint per `knowledge_base/engineering/00_tooling_decision_tree.md` Question 0, and capture `verification_note` and `open_questions`.
2. **Save verified source map to `config/counties/<county_slug>.json`** — The recon's output IS the populated county config. Copy from `_template.json`, populate every required field per source.
3. **Validate county config** — Run `python -m jsonschema config/counties/_schema.json config/counties/<county_slug>.json`. Must exit 0. P0 gate: at least one P0 source must be unblocked or have a committed unblock plan. `UNVERIFIED` and `NOT_FOUND` sources require `operator_override: true`.
4. **Run portal fingerprinting** — confirm `data/recon/<source_id>.fingerprint.json` exists for every source; adapter modules are selected from the fingerprint.
5. **Build one thin vertical slice** — Phase 1 synthetic harness → Phase 2 first adapter (usually parcel master enrichment) → Phase 3 first lead source. Prove one source end-to-end before scaling.
6. **Run tests** — `python scaffold/tests/run_all.py` must exit 0 (golden path + county-agnostic regression). Adapter fixture tests must pass per `engineering/05_verification_and_rollback.md`.
7. **Build remaining sources** — Phase 4 property matcher + review queue. Add additional adapters in `build_priority` order.
8. **Deploy dashboard** — Phase 5 dashboard customization → Phase 6 verification gate (mechanical verification + the §20 semantic verification contract; the production live-browser verifier is deferred to a future harness release) → Phase 7 refresh harness + alerts → Phase 8 `BUILD_SUMMARY.md`.

## How to run the gate tests

The framework ships with two gate tests that must pass before any build is considered shippable. Run them both with one command:

```
python scaffold/tests/run_all.py
```

Both tests can also be run individually if you want focused output:

```
python scaffold/tests/test_golden_path.py
python scaffold/tests/test_county_agnostic_regression.py
```

The runner exits 0 only when every test exits 0.

## Versioning

This is **v5.5.0 (stable)**.

- Patch (5.0.1) — clarifications, doc fixes
- Minor (5.1.0) — new patterns, sources, deal paths, architecture additions
- Major (6.0.0) — breaking changes requiring migration of existing county builds

**v5.5.0 added** (released 2026-06-26):

- **Source category expansion** — 15 mandatory Phase 0.A recon queries and 29 recognized lead types (#5).
- **Per-state lis pendens classification** — config-driven `state_rule_family` foreclosure regime, county-agnostic (#2).
- **PII guard for operator-authored county code** — gate test `test_no_pii_in_operator_code.py` + pre-commit hook + installer (#3).
- Added `IN_judicial_foreclosure` to the `state_rule_family` schema enum (#4).

**v5.4.0 added** (released 2026-06-25):

- **Executable §17–§20 staged pipeline** — normalize → classify → match → aggregate → score → review → dashboard. Monolith core retired.
- **Option-Y scoring seam** — `matched_leads.json` → scoring/dashboard cutover.
- **§20 semantic verification + evidence wire-through** (Session 5).
- **§19 idempotent aggregator** (Session 4).
- **9 deferred §17 debtor rules** implemented across 12 doc types; multi-owner contract extension; doc-type namespace bridge (R1/G1).

**v5.3.1 added** (released 2026-05-19):

- Removed the hardcoded county-slug default in `build_leads.py` and `verify_synthetic_harness.py`; both now auto-discover the active county config.

**v5.3.0 added** (released 2026-05-18):

- **§16 Source of Record Matrix** — the authoritative source for each field.
- **§17 Debtor Party Rules** — debtor-party identification rules.
- **§18 Signal Aggregation Contract** — combining signals across sources.
- **§19 Aggregator Idempotency Rule** — re-runs never duplicate or drift records.
- **§20 Semantic Verification Contract** — the semantic verification gate.
- **§13.14 enrichment-decoupling amendment** — enrichment is decoupled from lead origination.
- **§01 County Recon Protocol** upgrade and the new **§02 Build Mode Protocol**.
- 10 new framework invariants.
- Stub honesty disclosure for `verify_live.py` and `watchdog.py`.

**v5.2.0 added** (released 2026-05-15):

- **§13 Lead Origination Contract** — what events may originate a lead.

**v5.0.0 added** (released 2026-05-13):

- **Five-Layer Source Verification Gate** (MASTER_PROMPT Section 4.7) — every source goes through Official Origin → Source Category → Data Access → Lead Value / Source Role → Portal Proof verification before being trusted.
- **Source proof packet** — 18 new fields per source recording the verification outcome.
- **Build Eligibility Gate** (Section 4.10) — Phase 0 produces a `build_verdict` (`READY_TO_BUILD` / `READY_WITH_BLOCKERS` / `RECON_ONLY` / `WAITING_ON_ACCESS` / `NOT_BUILDABLE_YET`). Build Mode does not start without authorization.
- **Do Not Proceed Matrix** (Section 4.11) — 11 conditions that halt Phase 0 with a diagnostic verdict.
- **No False Dashboard rule** — a dashboard row is created by a lead event, never by a parcel record alone.
- **Source Hierarchy** (Section 4.9) — Tier 1 primary lead / Tier 2 supporting / Tier 3 enrichment. Only Tier 1 creates leads.
- **Recon Mode vs Build Mode** (Section 4.6) — first run is always Recon Mode.
- **VIP-friendly verdict message** (Section 4.12) — plain English Phase 0 output.
- **Operator-readable lead names rule** (Section 4.13) — no raw clerk codes in operator-facing surfaces.
- **Schema breaking changes** — 26 new source-level fields, 3 new top-level fields, 7 new enum types. v4.x configs require Phase 0 re-recon to populate new proof packet fields.

**v4.1.0 added** (preserved in v5.0.0): the one-sentence install flow, `scaffold/bootstrap_county.py`, `START_HERE.md`, `MASTER_PROMPT.md` Section 4.5 (autonomous first-run rule), and the `runs/<slug>/` directory convention.

Each county's `BUILD_SUMMARY.md` records the framework version it was built against.

## What this framework refuses to do

(From `domain/06_hallucination_controls.md` and the master prompt)

- Skip the live verification gate
- Ship leads without prime-directive labels (Confirmed / Estimated / Possible / Unknown)
- Declare a build done without `BUILD_SUMMARY.md` passing all checks
- Back-fill empty buckets with derived noise
- Generate leads from parcel-master metadata alone
- Mix synthetic data with real data in production `leads.json`
- Auto-merge entities when evidence is weak
