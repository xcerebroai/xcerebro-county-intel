doc_type_bridge — v5.4.0 Session 8 three-namespace doc-type reconciliation.

STATUS: BUILT in v5.4.0 Session 8. This module is the explicit, tested bridge
between the three doc-type namespaces the v5.4.0 cutover has to keep in sync:

  1. The monolith's `normalize_doc_type` output (`scaffold/pipeline/normalize.py`)
     — UPPERCASE registry keys (e.g. `TAX_DEED`, `NOTICE_OF_SALE`).
  2. The canonical_doc_types.json registry
     (`knowledge_base/domain/canonical_doc_types.json`) — the same UPPERCASE
     keys; the bridge lowercases them for the staged engine's input.
  3. §16's lead-type taxonomy
     (`knowledge_base/architecture/16_source_of_record_matrix.md`) — 27
     Title-Case lead-type names (e.g. `Tax Sale`, `Eviction`).

Contracts:
  - knowledge_base/architecture/22_doc_type_bridge.md (the Session 8 bridge
    design note — the rationale, the gap log, and the bridge's totality rule).
  - knowledge_base/architecture/17_debtor_party_rules.md §17.K (the Session 8
    amendment recording the plural-key rename and the 7-key reconciliation).

What the bridge guarantees (the cutover gate):
  - **Totality over normalize.py.** Every UPPERCASE value `normalize.py` can
    emit lowercases to a registry-aligned canonical_doc_type the staged engine
    accepts. There is no monolith output the bridge silently drops.
  - **Determinism.** The bridge is a static mapping module; the same input
    produces the same output every call. No regex heuristics, no fuzzy match.
  - **Explicit gaps.** Where a registry doc type has NO §16 lead_type
    (enrichment, negative signal, sub-type), the mapping value is `None` and
    the reason is documented in REGISTRY_WITHOUT_LEAD_TYPE_REASONS. Where a §16
    lead type has no registry equivalent (currently only "Tax Delinquency",
    which is a tax-roll status not a recorded document), it is listed in
    LEAD_TYPES_WITHOUT_REGISTRY_REASONS. NO mapping is invented to fill a gap.
  - **County-agnostic.** This module contains no county / state / vendor
    literal. The county-agnostic regression scanner enforces that.

This module is universal framework code: the three taxonomies are universal,
and the bridge between them is universal. Per-county doc-type synonyms layer
on top via the existing `county_synonyms` argument of
`normalize.normalize_doc_type`, not here.
